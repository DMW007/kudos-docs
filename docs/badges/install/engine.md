#### Step 11: Run the Kudos Badge Engine to Award the Badges

```
Now that you have loaded the default metrics and badges you are ready to start awarding the badges to users. By default, Kudos Badges will start
awarding badges at midnight each day. However, if you would like to start awarding badges immediately rather than waiting until the next scheduled
run, you can click the Award Badges Now button.
