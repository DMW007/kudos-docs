Create A Board \u00b6 From the My Boards homepage, click on the New Board button. Enter a name and description for your new board. Don't worry you can edit these later. Select any users or groups you would like to add to your board. Also select if you would like to share this board with the rest of your team. These settings can be changed after a board has been created as well. Select from our range of quick templates; Search the template library for a more sophisticated template; Or Select Blank to choose your own adventure! Click Create The board is now ready to use! Add Lists and Cards \u00b6 Add lists to a board to categorise todos and entries. Click on Add a List to add a new list to your board. Click on Add a Card in any list to add a card to that list. Add cards to your lists to represent Tasks, Work Items, Decisions, Ideas, Notes, Options, Sub-lists - Really anything you need them to represent. The beauty of this design is that you can use lists and cards to mean anything you need to for the task at hand. Assign Tasks To Others \u00b6 Assign Tasks to people in the board by either dragging their photo from the members panel in the right side bar. Or use the Assign Users control from the card details view. When you assign a card to a person, they are notified of the assignment via email and also via any news feeds that board has access to (Workspace chat, Connections activity stream, etc.). Plan Your Tasks \u00b6 Boards lets you assign due dates to card to help you better plan your tasks. Go to the Timeline View in a board to view the cards by their due dates. To set a due date on a card, or to change a due date simply drag the card to another list. For example, dragging a card from the No Date list to the Tomorrow list sets the due date of that card to tomorrow. View Card Details \u00b6 Click on a card to open it. The card details popup gives you access to a whole range of information and controls for the card. It lets you view and edit the card's name, completion status, description, tags, attachments, comments, due date, colour labels, fields and much more! Edit Board Options \u00b6 Click on the Edit icon on the top right of the board to open the Board details view. This view lets you edit the board's name, description, tags, due date and more. It also let's you create a templates and archive the board. Add and Remove Board Members \u00b6 Click on Members in the right sidebar to open the Board Members view. You can view all the orgs, individuals and groups who have access to this board. If you have Owner role for the board, you can also add and remove members from this view. Colour Code Your Cards \u00b6 Kudos Boards allows you to colour code your tasks by simply dragging and dropping the colours from the right sidebar onto cards. You can also assign custom text labels to each of the colours by simply clicking the edit icon in the Colour Labels section in the right sidebar. These labels are set at the board level and everyone in the board will see the same labels. Colour Code Your Boards \u00b6 Kudos Boards let's you colour code all your boards to help you personally manage and categorise your work. To colour code a board tile in the My Boards view, simply drag a colour from the left sidebar and drop it on a board. Much like card colour labels, you can also add custom text labels to these colours, however, this is for your personal organisation and as such will only be visible to you.

(optional) Monitoring prometheus/grafana - (optional) Server information \u00b6 As the name swarm suggests, this setup is designed to run across a number of servers (referred to as nodes). ISW recommends that the minimum number of servers you should start with is 4, being one for the NFS server and http gateway and 3 swarm managers. You may start with small VMs to set this up and expand them as your need increases (either by extending cores and ram on the existing servers or by adding more manager/worker nodes to your swarm). This document will assume the following setup: Gateway server (CentOS) 3 Swarm managers (CoreOS) If you have more managers or workers just extend the config where indicated below. If you are testing this setup, you can get away with quite small servers (we have had success with 2 cores and 1.7gb ram) however if you plan to include the logging and/or monitoring services then you should expect to dedicate an additional 1gb ram minimum for each of these sevices. The Gateway Server will be used for storing all persistent data in nfs shares, if you are setting this environment up for a production system then you should ensure that you have a suitably performant disk for the path /data on this server, you should also ensure that this folder is backed up appropriately.

When configuring the servers, you will need to enable the following network rules: http(s) traffic should be allowed to the Gateway only ssh traffic should be allowed to all servers Where possible all servers should be on an additional (internal only) subnet, this allows us to further lock down access to NFS shares Setup Ansible \u00b6 See Ansible setup guide . Download and extract This zip file Server access \u00b6 Ansible uses ssh to communicate with the servers so you'll need to be able to access them from your shell directly. The ideal way to achieve this is to setup key based authentication, however there are workarounds that can be done if you have to use password based authentication. For more info on setting up an ssh private key, see this tutorial As mentioned in the linked article, we will need to add each of our servers to our local list of known hosts, this is done by manually connecting to each of them for our shell. ssh -i path/to/keyfile <username>@<server_ip> e.g. ssh -i /home/nicky/.ssh/id_rsa nicky@10.10.10.1 Config \u00b6 Download this hosts file and update the values as follows: Key Description all.hosts.gateway.ansible_host IP For Gateway server accessible from your machine all.hosts.nfs_server.ansible_host IP For Gateway server accessible from your machine all.hosts.nfs_server.internal_ip internal IP For Gateway server, if you do not have an internal subnet, use the same IP as above all.hosts.manager(1,2,3).ansible_host IP For Manager node accessible from your machine all.hosts.manager(1,2,3).internal_ip internal IP For Manager node, if you do not have an internal subnet, use the same IP as above all.vars.ansible_user Your username on all servers all.vars.ansible_ssh_private_key_file Full path to your keyfile (leave blank if using password auth) all.vars.swarm_ip_mask ip mask that matches your internal subnet e.g. 10.10.10.10/24, or that matches all swarm nodes if you do not have an internal subnet all.vars.ssl_certs For ssl to work on your environment, you need to have a pem encoded certificate and keyfile for each domain you plan to serve on.
